From now on, we move\\nfrom desktop applications to Software as a Service (SaaS),\\nwhere users have to forget initial setup costs, paying only\\nfor the use they consume. Moreover, we have implemented a web platform to\\nautomatize the creation of test scenarios just providing the initial and final\\nvalue of the parameters one wants to study. These test are run in\\na private cloud deployed using the framework OpenNebula and KVM, where the deployment of the\\nvirtual machines and the maintenance of the computing infrastructure\\nis completely transparent to the final user.\",\n          \"Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing technology used primarily for estimating displacement of the earth's surface with millimeter-level precision. Phase unwrapping is the most important step in InSAR processing and relies heavily on successful selection of \\u2018stable pixels\\u2019: points that appear stable across set of satellite images taken over time. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for selecting these pixels, a problem known as persistent scatterer selection. The algorithm computes the temporal coherence on the wrapped phase derivative by subtracting phases of a pixel and one of its nearby neighbors. This algorithm does not require model assumptions and does not compromise solution accuracy. Motivated by the abundance of parallelism the algorithm exposes, we have implemented it for NVIDIA GPUs. Evaluation using real-world data shows that the GPU implementation not only offers widely superior performance but also scales linearly with number of GPUs and the workload size. We compare the GPU implementation against the CPU implementation we have developed initially: On a single NVIDIA GeForce GTX Titan GPU, the GPU implementation offers a 18x speedup over the CPU implementation on a pair of Intel Xeon E5 2650v2 CPUs, while four GPUs offer 65x speedup. Additionally, for the same workload, the GPU implementation consumes 29x less energy than the CPU implementation.\",\n          \"Fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) is a clustering method which is based on the partial membership concept. As with the other clustering methods, FCM applies a distance to cluster the data. While the Euclidean distance is widely-used to perform the clustering task, other distances have been suggested in the literature. In this paper we study the use of a weighted combination of metrics in FCM clustering of time series where the weights in the combination are the outcome of an optimization process using differential evolution, genetic algorithms, and particle swarm optimization as optimizers. We show how the overfitting phenomenon interferes in the optimization process that the optimal results obtained during the training stage degrade during the testing stage as a result of overfitting.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"decision\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":
